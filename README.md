# Predictive Health Insurance Model for Shield Insurance

AtliQ AI will develop a predictive model for Shield Insurance to estimate health insurance
premiums based on factors like age, smoking habits, BMI, and medical history. 

- A predictive model is built and deployed using streamlit application.

- Developed a high-accuracy (>97%) predictive model. The percentage difference between
the predicted and actual value on a minimum of 95% of the errors is less than 10%.

- Deployed the model in the cloud so that an insurance underwriter can run it from anywhere.
  
- Created an interactive Streamlit application that an underwriter can use for predictions.

## Data collection and Preprocessing :
- Collected and cleaned labelled data sets
- Performed Exploratory data analysis
## Model Development
- Train and evaluate multiple models.
- Optimize the best model for accuracy
## Model Deployment
- Deploy the model on a cloud platform.
- Ensure security and scalability.
## Streamlit Application Development
- Build an interactive app for inputting factors and displaying predictions.
## Testing and Validation
- Rigorous testing and validation with real-world data.
